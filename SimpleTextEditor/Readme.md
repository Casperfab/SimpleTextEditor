This solution is part of an assignment to create a SimpleTextEditor. Unfortunately due to time constraints the solution is not in an optimal state and only works partial.
Subjects which require improvements:

1. Undo function does not work at all
2. Backspace is more similar to a delete function: you have to hover over the field which needs deletion
3. Dependency injection is not setup
4. Key movements does sometime loose track of correct cursor position
